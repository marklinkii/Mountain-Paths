## Mountain-Paths

This program reads a file of elevation data and outputs a ppm file with the shortest path from one side to the other. The ppm file can then be converted into a jpg for viewing the paths.

Inputs are image size (rows then columns in pixels) and data file name. 

In the output file, the red lines are the shortest path given your starting position and the green line is the overall shortest path.

Sample output:
