## Mountain-Paths

This program reads a file of elevation data and outputs an image with the shortest path from one side to the other. 

Inputs are image size (rows then columns in pixels) and data file name. 

In the output file, the red lines are the shortest path given your starting position and the green line is the overall shortest path.

Sample output:
